# Van's Recursive Narrative Fluid Dynamics Model

# 1. Symbolic Framework
# Variables from symbolic/narrative framework
S = 'Stars'          # Initial energy, chaos potential
M = 'Myths'          # Pattern encoding, inherited recursion
L = 'Lies'           # Entropy, distortion
D = 'Direction'      # The fourth corner, Delta (Δ)
T = 'Time'           # Recursion loop variable
C = 'Code'           # Alphabetic system, translation keys
N = 'Numbers'        # Measurement, symbolic quantification
F = 'Force'          # Flow, narrative acceleration
P = 'Pressure'       # Pattern complexity / emotional resistance
V = 'Velocity'       # Story flow

# 2. Distortion Equation
# Total distortion from inherited variables
# δ = distortion
# R = translation
# Truth as limit function when delta is reconciled over unworked D

distortion = lambda S, M, L: S + M + L
translation = lambda C, N, delta: f"Translate({C} + {N} + {delta})"
truth = lambda R, D: f"lim(D→∞) of {R}"  # Symbolic limit of recursion as generative truth

# 3. Energy Liberation Function
# Integrate work of the first 3 corners to find stored energy in the 4th
from sympy import symbols, integrate
W = symbols('W1 W2 W3 t')
energy_liberated = lambda W1, W2, W3: f"{distortion(S, M, L)} - ∫0^3({W1} + {W2} + {W3})dt"

# 4. Narrative Navier-Stokes Overlay
# Fluid dynamics analogy with narrative mapping
# ρ = recursion density
# ∇Φ = fourth corner potential (unexhausted)
navier_stokes_narrative = '''
ρ(T) * [∂Story/∂t + (Story ⋅ ∇)Story] = -∇Belief + μ∇²Story + (S + M + L) + ∇Φ
'''

# 5. Delta Prime - Potential from Non-Recursion
# Delta prime is potential energy held in restraint (the unworked 4th corner)
delta_prime = "Δ' = lim_{r → 4} (1 - R(r)) = unwritten potential"

# 6. Output Summary
